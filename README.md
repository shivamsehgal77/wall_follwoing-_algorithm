# wall_follwoing_algorithm
* To setup the project follow file RWA2_ENPM809Y_FALL22-v0.1.1.pdf
* The application file contains all the files needed to run the simulation
* CPS.h is the class declaration and CPS.cpp contains all the definitions of the methods
* In the simulator use the main_left for the left wall algorithm and main_right for right wall algorithm
